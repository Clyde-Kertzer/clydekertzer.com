Hello! My name is Clyde Kertzer and I am a senior studying mathematics at University of Colorado, Boulder. I hope to go to grad school for number theory, but I also enjoy representation theory and character theory! I am tutor for <a href="https://prepacademytutors.com/location/boulder/?tutor=clyde-k">Prep Academy</a>.

My honors thesis, [_Parameterizations of Descartes Quadruples_](/files/HonorsThesis.pdf) was advised by Professor <a href="https://math.katestange.net">Katherine E. Stange</a> and Professor <a href="https://math.colorado.edu/~jari2770">James Rickards</a>.

An article about a paper I wrote (with <a href="https://math.colorado.edu/~suha3163/">Summer Haag</a>, James Rickards and <a href="https://math.katestange.net">Katherine E. Stange</a>) was published in <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/two-students-unravel-a-widely-believed-math-conjecture-20230810/">Quanta magazine</a>.

## Other Interests

When I'm not doing math, I'm probably playing soccer or hockey, watching the USMNT, or playing the trombone!
