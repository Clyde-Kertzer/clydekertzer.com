Hello! My name is Clyde Kertzer and I am a senior studying mathematics at University of Colorado, Boulder. I have applied to grad school for number theory, but I also enjoy representation theory and character theory! I am tutor at the <a href="https://www.mathnasium.com/math-centers/boulder">Mathnasium</a> and for <a href="https://prepacademytutors.com/location/boulder/?tutor=clyde-k">Prep Academy</a>.

## Other Interests

When I'm not doing math, I'm probably playing soccer or hockey, watching the USMNT, or playing the trombone!
