Hello! I’m Clyde Kertzer — a recent mathematics graduate from the University of Colorado, Boulder with a focus on number theory, algebra, and cryptographic systems. I’ve conducted research published in Annals of Mathematics, built mathematical visualizations and encryption tools, and have experience tutoring advanced undergraduate topics. I'm now seeking opportunities in cryptography, cybersecurity, and mathematical software development.

## Other Interests

When I'm not doing math, I'm probably playing soccer or hockey, watching the USMNT, or playing the trombone!
